                <strong>
                         Earlier this week, the high priestess of the Follichite Church has fallen ill, as such, no services will be taking place this week.
                         However, offerings for the clergy and the Follicle will still be accepted if you wish to give them. The high priestess is expected to be in full health
                         by next week, if he doesn't recover, the Carrier will serve as the priestess for that week.
                </strong>

                <strong>
                         All Follichites and non-ops have been invited to attend the Follichite Convention on Saturday. It will be held at 13:57 UTC in the 
                         British Indian Ocean Territory. There, Lord, Sir, Se√±or Mr. Follicle himself will be giving speeches on changes in the Church and plans for the coming quarter.
                         THERE WILL BE FREE FOOD. So please come and listen to what he has to say.

                <strong>
                    As usual, we interviewed a few commoners. This week, we asked them for their opinions on the state of the Church.
                        From Eauggh, a follower of the Follicle, "I think it's fine."

                        From Follihater, a non-follower, "[i]t should be burnt to the ground; honestly, we should storm it with flames and pitchforks."
